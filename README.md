# Jurassic Park User Interface Prototype

I created a prototype of an interface for a Jurassic Park employee to control various automated features of the theme park. This project includes HCI techniques such as strong affordances, feedback, mapping, constraints, mental models, information architecture, and user testing. 

Using Javascript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, and user feedback, I've iterated on my design to improve its usability. Here is a screeshot of the
iterative project

I have tested this interface with real users, and have thought about human perception, psychology, and how they interpret interfaces from an emotional and aesthetic standpoint.
